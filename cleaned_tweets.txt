b'HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK?  Well, doctors say it looks like mask-wearing will last longer than originally anticipated even as a new vaccine is expected on the market by next month.
b'_Genuine This is not smart. You would take a test for something you don't have because we know people can be ASYMPTOMATIC. You take a vaccine to protect yourself from getting it. Medical racism aside, this is how tests and vaccines typically work. The vaccine isn't for when you have it '

b' As humans we get stuck in one gear. Covid requires a multi prong approach not just a vaccine strategy. Scientists should be working on treatment for coronavirus. We have Tamiflu, we need a Coviflu. Everyone is not going to take the vaccine. We need a plan in place for that.'
b'By the end of March, Pfizer and Moderna expect to have provided the U.S. government with a total of 220 million vaccine doses, up sharply from the roughly 75 million shipped so far.

b'Alabama is largely poor, rural, and unhealthy. When the state rejected Medicaid expansion, it stressed an overburdened public health system that has seen rural healthcare access evaporate. In February 2020, one quarter of Alabama hospitals risked closure. 
b'  I'm sorry it hasn't been my experience. My grandchildren have been home since the start and they have excelled not fallen behind. Give the vaccine to teacher and students and provide proper ventilation systems to the schools that need them first'
b"Alabama's process for vetting clinics and pharmacies to give vaccinations ended up giving an edge to those who got in line first or who had more resources. An overreliance on internet vaccine appointments, which favor wealthier people, made matters worse 
b'2  I apologize for insulting you but I stand by the fact that no U.S. death has been attributed to the vaccine itself. Over 1,000,000 people have received it and most of them over 65. 100's die in this age category every day and did long before we ever heard of Covid-19.'

b'I'm on like 509 call lists for a vaccine appointment. Somebody call me back PLEASE chile '
b'2  All people are entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. Name one person who has been confirmed by medical authorities to have died from a Covid-19 vaccine.'
b' 2 Do what you want with your own body but stop spreading lies about a vaccine that can save people. I have buried three friends who were killed by Covid. The last was younger than me and spent 5 weeks on a respirator before dying at UAB. I have had both doses w/ no problems.'

b' A study came out today stating that 2/3 of COVID-19 hospitalizations are associated with one or more of four pre-existing conditions. I have one of these, through no fault of my own, yet can't get a vaccine in Alabama because I'm 62. Why???'

b'The vaccine industry is always looking for human test subjects. They are most successful when they can find stocks that they are not in a position to reject.Soldiers (9), infants, the disabled, prisoners, those in developing nations - anyone who is not in a position to refuse.'
b'In the mid-2000s there was a lot of talk about "pandemic preparedness." Flu vaccine manufacturers in the United States received billions of dollars from taxpayers to develop vaccines to make sure we donget another deadly pandemic "flu," like 1918-19.'
b"The Spanish flu started where this experimental bacterial vaccine was administered, making it a prime suspect as a source of bacterial infections that killed so many.2-Comment: Not very different from the way some call Covid-19 'Wuhan Flu', huh?"
b'Perhaps one of the reasons it has never been corrected is that it helps to hide the origin of the pandemic.If the origin of the pandemic involved a vaccine experiment on US soldiers, then the US may prefer to call it Spanish flu rather than the 1918 Fort Riley bacteria.'
b'The pandemic was not Spanish. The first cases of bacterial pneumonia in 1918 date back to military bases, the first at Fort Riley, Kansas. From January 21 to June 4, 1918, an experimental vaccine against bacterial meningitis ........'
b"The psychopath Rockefeller created the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918? It began with the Rockefeller Institute's crude bacterial meningitis vaccination experiment on American troops. The 1918-19 bacterial vaccine experiment may have killed 50-100 million people. (follow the thread)

b'  17 The son of one of the men who originally approved the vaccine was an editor of a prominent newspaper in London.  He hired a reporter to spread rumors about Dr. Wakefield.
b'  17 You see, there were people attempting for years to get this information hidden.  An executive of the manufacturer of the vaccine in question was also an officer of the parent company of the journal that published the paper.'
b'  17 She then went on to say "vaccines do not cause autism."  One is a lie.  Here is the video of her appearance on CNN in 2007.  She is now president of Merckinternational vaccine division.
b'  17 The CDC got wind of this and decided to look into it.  They did, and initially found a 760% increased risk of autism based on vaccines given in the first month of life alone.  This was not the mmr vaccine and it was most definitely not the entire schedule.'
b'  17 Do yourself a favor and read it.  They do not claim the vaccine caused autism.  They simply convey what the parents reported, which was that both autism and bowel troubles began directly after receiving the vaccine.  It would have been fraudulent and unethical not to report that.'

b'It would be super messed up for everyone except the Russian people to benefit from the Russian tax dollars that supported vaccine development and the Russian bodies put through clinical trials that showed everyone else it was effective and safe enough to import.'
b'I'm actually rooting for Russia to succeed.It would help the world and stop the spread before even more new variants come out if Russia could deliver on producing hundreds of millions of vaccines for export and get ready to ramp up their new vaccine that's even more robust.'

b'   _t2 Hard to see on previous. CoVID deaths did go up. But worse last April. Before vaccine etc. 
b"   _t2 Actually the graph is accurate, but the supposition that the vaccine caused the deaths is spurious. Care home deaths did go up. But since they've all been vaccinated, the Feb number dropped and I bet it continues to. Just shows how important it was to get it done. 
b"  1  _t2 Even the AZ vaccine, which is a virus in of itself, doesn't act like a human virus in human cells. Just there to be seen in the bloodstream."
b"  1  _t2 DNA is unaffected. The CoVID virus might credibly become encoded, but that's a rarity. The vaccines have no chance of doing so. So vaccine is better for your DNA. The breakdown of mRNA is well studied. Has been for decades. It isn't replicated. Not how Central Dogma works."
b"   _t2 US issue. We have the MHRA and they have given the go ahead for AZ and Pfizer. Pretty FDA have approved vaccine use. As have the EMA. They're independent of each other, so unless they're in a mass conspiracy... the vaccines seem safe enough."
b'. my mom received a  updatemail from her vaccine team "not worry if your second dose falls outside the recommended 42-day window". That is not what the CDC says. It says 28 days. She received her first dose but timing on her 2nd is a mystery. Answers please!'
b" _Editor  _t2 Because the focus was on the vaccine. Warp speed also had nothing to do with at least 2 of the vaccines. Perhaps because the evidence didn't stack up either? 
b'   _t2 You conflating standard "dongive this to pregnant women unless you have to" advise with "vaccine stops you being able to have babies". Conspiracists gonna conspire, but thata leap.'
b' _Editor  _t2 Agree many cures and treatments are to be found in nature. Most medicines have been. But this is a vaccine. In line with everything from cowpox to polio. Eradication is possible and we know the vaccines work.'
b" _Editor  _t2 
b' _Editor  _t2 What other options? Ask for the AZ vaccine? Sure. If you want. Nobody is going to jab you without your permission, but civic minded duty and community feeling should motivate sufficient numbers of volunteers, to reduce the impact of the reticent.'
b" _Editor  _t2 The falling death rates in the vaccinated groups is pretty good data. We have other treatments if you get ill, dexamethasone etc. They'll keep you alive. But better to not get dramatically I'll in the first place. The vaccine won't cause NSE. Unrelated."
b" _Editor  _t2 That's not true. They literally train the immune system. The only things that can compromise the immune system are a disease like HIV, genetic disorders like SCID, diet and stress etc. The vaccine simply shows the immune system something to develop against."
b" _Editor  _t2 The vaccine is readily available. It's what the rollout is. Making it available. Inflammation can happen because of pollen. It's just a natural response. Easily contained too, which is why they monitor you after the jab. Very cautious. Nobody is trying to con/hurt you."
b' _Editor  _t2 No. The vaccine simply immunised your system against a specific spike. If the virus mutates it might be less useful, but the vaccine has nothing to do with that.'
b" _News  It's gene modification marketed and trademarked as Vaccine capital V"
b'_com  _t2 The AZ vaccine is a modified chimp virus. They add the spike sequence to the genome of that virus and replicate it up. The virus then sits there, unable to affect human cells even after being injected, but with a COVID spike that can be recognised and used to prime the T-Cells.'
b" 3r93 From the Aaby study I just skimmed, it appears to not be the vaccine per se, which does protect against the diseases it's meant to, but something to do with the sequence they're given in in early life in combination with other vaccs. Overload? Nutrition? Needs looking at."
b" 1  _t2 Also the mRNA is not able to do that in an uninfected cell anyway. It will simply be read, used to assemble the spike protein into the right shape and done. It can't mutate, because there is no replication involved. So the protein shape will remain true to the vaccine."
b'202020 1  _t2 Agree. But much of the science is. The AZ vaccine is being given away at cost, so not all rotten.'
b"16  _t2 She claims that the vaccine will somehow trigger an autoimmune response, but the thymus weeds out any T cells that could recognise human proteins. That's how the immune system works. It creates a multiplicity of random sequences, weeds out the self-recognisong ones and waits."
b"_com  _t2 Human genome is littered with ancient viruses. I doubt the vaccine will act in the same way as a native virus, but it's not beyond the realms of possibility. However, the wild virus would too. So do you risk not being immunised and suffer the full infection, or vaccinate?"

b'1977  Your body makes mRNA trillions of times per second. It is the messenger between the DNA in the nucleus and the ribosome factory that makes the proteins. The viral antigen protein is foreign to the immune system. All vaccine does is let your body make the antigen. Priming it.'
