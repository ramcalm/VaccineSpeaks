b'@Lewisdpi @MartinAntkowiak @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Hard to see on previous. CoVID deaths did go up. But worse last April. Before vaccine etc. https://t.co/jfBRgFKbMC'
b"@Lewisdpi @MartinAntkowiak @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Actually the graph is accurate, but the supposition that the vaccine caused the deaths is spurious. Care home deaths did go up. But since they've all been vaccinated, the Feb number dropped and I bet it continues to. Just shows how important it was to get it done. https://t.co/ZkVmIhnS2r"
b"@GrandePois @StarrSilvar @ukboffin1 @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Even the AZ vaccine, which is a virus in of itself, doesn't act like a human virus in human cells. Just there to be seen in the bloodstream."
b"@StarrSilvar @GrandePois @ukboffin1 @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 DNA is unaffected. The CoVID virus might credibly become encoded, but that's a rarity. The vaccines have no chance of doing so. So vaccine is better for your DNA. The breakdown of mRNA is well studied. Has been for decades. It isn't replicated. Not how Central Dogma works."
b"@MartinAntkowiak @Lewisdpi @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 US issue. We have the MHRA and they have given the go ahead for AZ and Pfizer. Pretty FDA have approved vaccine use. As have the EMA. They're independent of each other, so unless they're in a mass conspiracy... the vaccines seem safe enough."
b'.@GovernorTomWolf my mom received a \'no update\' email from her vaccine team "not worry if your second dose falls outside the recommended 42-day window". That is not what the CDC says. It says 28 days. She received her first dose but timing on her 2nd is a mystery. Answers please!'
b"@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Because the focus was on the vaccine. Warp speed also had nothing to do with at least 2 of the vaccines. Perhaps because the evidence didn't stack up either? https://t.co/gH9JAtUsCg"
b'@MartinAntkowiak @Lewisdpi @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 You\'re conflating standard "don\'t give this to pregnant women unless you have to" advise with "vaccine stops you being able to have babies". Conspiracists gonna conspire, but that\'s a leap.'
b'@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Agree many cures and treatments are to be found in nature. Most medicines have been. But this is a vaccine. In line with everything from cowpox to polio. Eradication is possible and we know the vaccines work.'
b"@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 https://t.co/0whIwDc17OAgain. Not sure that's proven. Also, not willing to start smoking and risk all the known side effects, versus a mild risk of inflammation from a vaccine. Vaccines work. They eradicate disease."
b'@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 What other options? Ask for the AZ vaccine? Sure. If you want. Nobody is going to jab you without your permission, but civic minded duty and community feeling should motivate sufficient numbers of volunteers, to reduce the impact of the reticent.'
b"@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 The falling death rates in the vaccinated groups is pretty good data. We have other treatments if you get ill, dexamethasone etc. They'll keep you alive. But better to not get dramatically I'll in the first place. The vaccine won't cause NSE. Unrelated."
b"@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 That's not true. They literally train the immune system. The only things that can compromise the immune system are a disease like HIV, genetic disorders like SCID, diet and stress etc. The vaccine simply shows the immune system something to develop against."
b"@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 The vaccine is readily available. It's what the rollout is. Making it available. Inflammation can happen because of pollen. It's just a natural response. Easily contained too, which is why they monitor you after the jab. Very cautious. Nobody is trying to con/hurt you."
b'@silversynergy @DJT_Editor @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 No. The vaccine simply immunised your system against a specific spike. If the virus mutates it might be less useful, but the vaccine has nothing to do with that.'
b"@JohnFrancisBC @Beaking_News @jahwibble It's gene modification marketed and trademarked as Vaccine capital V"
b'@ejectamenta_com @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 The AZ vaccine is a modified chimp virus. They add the spike sequence to the genome of that virus and replicate it up. The virus then sits there, unable to affect human cells even after being injected, but with a COVID spike that can be recognised and used to prime the T-Cells.'
b"@silversynergy @laurenmill3r93 From the Aaby study I just skimmed, it appears to not be the vaccine per se, which does protect against the diseases it's meant to, but something to do with the sequence they're given in in early life in combination with other vaccs. Overload? Nutrition? Needs looking at."
b"@silversynergy @ukboffin1 @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Also the mRNA is not able to do that in an uninfected cell anyway. It will simply be read, used to assemble the spike protein into the right shape and done. It can't mutate, because there is no replication involved. So the protein shape will remain true to the vaccine."
b'@Thisisus202020 @ukboffin1 @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Agree. But much of the science is. The AZ vaccine is being given away at cost, so not all rotten.'
b"@Jabbarjamal16 @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 She claims that the vaccine will somehow trigger an autoimmune response, but the thymus weeds out any T cells that could recognise human proteins. That's how the immune system works. It creates a multiplicity of random sequences, weeds out the self-recognisong ones and waits."
b"@ejectamenta_com @stevencooganUK @blackswan_t2 Human genome is littered with ancient viruses. I doubt the vaccine will act in the same way as a native virus, but it's not beyond the realms of possibility. However, the wild virus would too. So do you risk not being immunised and suffer the full infection, or vaccinate?"

b'@simsy1977 @jwrotherham Your body makes mRNA trillions of times per second. It is the messenger between the DNA in the nucleus and the ribosome factory that makes the proteins. The viral antigen protein is foreign to the immune system. All vaccine does is let your body make the antigen. Priming it.'
